      "2. An NCO operator linked only to the classic netCDF3 library attempts to read netCDF4 (or HDF5) files. However, this executable seems to have been built with the capability to manipulate netCDF4 files, so it is unlikely that this command failed only because the input datasets are netCDF4 format. Something else is going wrong. \n",

NCO can access HDF4 files if NCO is first re-linked to a version of netCDF configured with the --enable-hdf4 option. This is a non-standard netCDF build option described here: http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/docs/build_hdf4.html. NCO can access PnetCDF/CDF5 files if NCO is first re-linked to netCDF version 4.4.0 or later.\n",

      "5. Access to a DAP URL fails, and the backup method of downloading the URL using wget obtains a data aggregation file (e.g., a .ncml file) instead of an actual netCDF file. In this case the problem is with the DAP server or URL.\n",

      "HINT: NC_ENOTNC errors can occur for many reasons. If your use-case matches one of the five listed below, take the corrective action indicated:\n",
      "1. The netCDF file is truly corrupt, e.g., truncated. To verify whether the file is corrupt, try, e.g., printing its metadata with 'ncks -m in.nc'. This test will likely fail on a corrupt file\n",
      "2. An NCO operator linked only to the classic netCDF3 library attempts to read netCDF4 (or HDF5) files. However, this executable seems to have been built with the capability to manipulate netCDF4 files, so it is unlikely that this command failed only because the input datasets are netCDF4 format. Something else is going wrong. \n",
      "3. NCO attempts to read other filetypes (HDF4, HDF-EOS2, PnetCDF/CDF5) for which support must be (but was not) enabled at netCDF build-time. NCO can access HDF4 files if NCO is first re-linked to a version of netCDF configured with the --enable-hdf4 option. This is a non-standard netCDF build option described here: http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/docs/build_hdf4.html. NCO can access PnetCDF/CDF5 files if NCO is first re-linked to netCDF version 4.4.0 or later.\n",
      "4. NCO attempts to utilize diskless (i.e., RAM) files.  In this case remove the diskless switches (e.g., --ram or --diskless) and then re-issue the command.\n",
      "5. Access to a DAP URL fails, and the backup method of downloading the URL using wget obtains a data aggregation file (e.g., a .ncml file) instead of an actual netCDF file. In this case the problem is with the DAP server or URL.\n",
      "nco_err_exit(): ERROR NCO will now exit with system call exit(EXIT_FAILURE)\n"

      "HINT: NC_ENOTNC errors can occur for many reasons. If your use-case matches one of the five listed below, take the corrective action indicated:\n",
      "1. The netCDF file is truly corrupt, e.g., truncated. To verify whether the file is corrupt, try, e.g., printing its metadata with 'ncks -m in.nc'. This test will likely fail on a corrupt file\n",
      "2. An NCO operator linked only to the classic netCDF3 library attempts to read netCDF4 (or HDF5) files. However, this executable seems to have been built with the capability to manipulate netCDF4 files, so it is unlikely that this command failed only because the input datasets are netCDF4 format. Something else is going wrong. \n",
      "3. NCO attempts to read other filetypes (HDF4, HDF-EOS2, PnetCDF/CDF5) for which support must be (but was not) enabled at netCDF build-time. NCO can access HDF4 files if NCO is first re-linked to a version of netCDF configured with the --enable-hdf4 option. This is a non-standard netCDF build option described here: http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/docs/build_hdf4.html. NCO can access PnetCDF/CDF5 files if NCO is first re-linked to netCDF version 4.4.0 or later.\n",
      "4. NCO attempts to utilize diskless (i.e., RAM) files.  In this case remove the diskless switches (e.g., --ram or --diskless) and then re-issue the command.\n",
      "5. Access to a DAP URL fails, and the backup method of downloading the URL using wget obtains a data aggregation file (e.g., a .ncml file) instead of an actual netCDF file. In this case the problem is with the DAP server or URL.\n",

      "1. The netCDF file is truly corrupt, e.g., truncated. To verify whether the file is corrupt, try, e.g., printing its metadata with 'ncks -m in.nc'. This test will likely fail on a corrupt file\n",
      "2. An NCO operator linked only to the classic netCDF3 library attempts to read netCDF4 (or HDF5) files. However, this executable seems to have been built with the capability to manipulate netCDF4 files, so it is unlikely that this command failed only because the input datasets are netCDF4 format. Something else is going wrong. \n",
      "3. NCO attempts to read other filetypes (HDF4, HDF-EOS2, PnetCDF/CDF5) for which support must be (but was not) enabled at netCDF build-time. NCO can access HDF4 files if NCO is first re-linked to a version of netCDF configured with the --enable-hdf4 option. This is a non-standard netCDF build option described here: http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/docs/build_hdf4.html. NCO can access PnetCDF/CDF5 files if NCO is first re-linked to netCDF version 4.4.0 or later.\n",
      "4. NCO attempts to utilize diskless (i.e., RAM) files.  In this case remove the diskless switches (e.g., --ram or --diskless) and then re-issue the command.\n",
      "5. Access to a DAP URL fails, and the backup method of downloading the URL using wget obtains a data aggregation file (e.g., a .ncml file) instead of an actual netCDF file. In this case the problem is with the DAP server or URL.\n",
