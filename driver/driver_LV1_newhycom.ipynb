A workaround for this might be to request data in smaller amounts at one time. This can be accomplished by accessing hyperslabs or multi-slabs of data as described at http://nco.sf.net/nco.html#mlt. 2) When NCO requests data from a buggy DAP library.

This can occur in multiple ways, including 1) When NCO requests (with nco_var_get()) more data than the server is configured to dispense at one time. A workaround for this might be to request data in smaller amounts at one time. This can be accomplished by accessing hyperslabs or multi-slabs of data as described at http://nco.sf.net/nco.html#mlt. 2) When NCO requests data from a buggy DAP library. The DAP software built into netCDF versions 4.6.2 and 4.6.3 is known to be problematic. The only solution for this would be to use an NCO built with a newer version (at least 4.7.3) of netCDF.\n",
